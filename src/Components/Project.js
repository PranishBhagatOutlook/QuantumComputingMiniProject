          The security of messages encoded via the widely used RSA public key
          encryption system rests on the enormous computational effort required
          to find the prime factors of a large number N using classical
          (conventional) computers. In 1994 Peter Shor showed that for
          sufficiently large N, a quantum computer could perform the factoring
          with much less computational effort. This project endeavors to
          explain, in a fashion comprehensible to the nonexpert, the RSA
          encryption protocol; the various quantum computer manipulations
          constituting the Shor algorithm; how the Shor algorithm performs the
          factoring; and the precise sense in which a quantum computer employing
          Shorâ€™s algorithm can be said to accomplish the factoring of very large
          numbers with less computational effort than a classical computer. It
          is made apparent that factoring N generally requires many successive
          runs of the algorithm. My analysis reveals that the probability of
          achieving a successful factorization on a single run is about twice as
          large as commonly quoted in the literature.

          In this project, we will be talking about encryption and implementing
          one of the most famous algorithms in the field: Shor's Algorithm.
          Shor's Algorithm is the premier example of a quantum algorithm that
          shows the power of quantum computation compared to classical
          computation today. This is because Shor's Algorithm provides a nearly
          exponential speed-up over the fastest known classical algorithm in
          finding prime factors of large numbers. But why is this so pertinent?
          Finding factors for large numbers is the basis of RSA encryption,
          which is a public key sharing scheme used for secure data transactions
          like credit card transactions. Under RSA encryption, messages can be
          encrypted with a code called a public key, which can be shared openly.
          Once a message has been encrypted with the public key, which is a very
          large number, it can only be decrypted by a private key, which is the
          prime factor of that large number. The larger the number, the more
          computational power it takes to find a prime factor and the more
          secure the encryption is. So the security of RSA relies on the fact
          that finding a prime factor of a large number, takes an extremely long
          time. To give you an idea of how long this would take, lets take the
          example of a 232 decimal digit semi prime number. A semi prime number
          is just the product of two prime numbers and its the hardest type of
          number to factorize. To factorize this number, you need roughly a 1000
          years of processing time on a typical laptop. Quantum computers
          running Shor's algorithm could one day shorten this way significantly
          but quantum processors today are far from being able to do this. In
          this project, we will focus on how to implement Shor's algorithm in
          Qiskit.
